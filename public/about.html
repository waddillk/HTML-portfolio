<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>With more than twenty years experience working in the non-profit education sector, I have sculpted my career in a unique path and applied my skills in many different areas. I have tackled the complexities of day-to-day program operations and attended to broader topics/projects ranging from talent management to board engagement to strategic planning to marketing. I love to share ideas, think about the big picture, and make everyday work. <br> <br>In my free time, I enjoy learning to design and develop websites that build awareness, provide information and/or offer functional interaction for a broad range of users. My skill and experience in project management, user access, teamwork and problem solving are essential in this process. The programming, search engine optimization and design work provides a channel for expanding how I analyze and think about information/data, create visual displays, communicate and engage end users.
